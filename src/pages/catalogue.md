This selective investigation of contemporary solo violoncello works written
between 1980 and 2010 consists of 1075 works, listed in alphabetical order of
country and in alphabetical order of composers of a relevant country.

Due to the extensive nature of this field, this research only includes works by
composers from eight European countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom), as well as Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and South Africa. In my considered opinion, the European
countries that have been selected are those with a very high musical culture
and where composers are very active in this field. The musical life of the
United States of America is so huge that it deserves a study of its own.

Relevant information of each entry are added, including the approximate
duration of each piece, the dedicatee, dates of first performances, recordings
and addresses of websites of individual composers. The catalogue is followed by
two appendices: one that lists the dedicatee in alphabetical order and the
other that lists the works by their approximate duration.

The study did not aim to examine the qualitative merits of every piece listed.
The catalogue only includes original works for solo violoncello, and music
exclusively written for beginner and intermediate levels has not been included.
Works written for violoncello and piano, violoncello and orchestra and an
amplified violoncello together with tape or electronic accompaniment are not
included in this catalogue. These are subjects for further investigation and
catalogue compilation.
